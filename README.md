## Contributions to third-party projects
Apart from donations in money, we would always contribute work to stay closely involved. Our ultimate goal is to become an integral part of developments that make a better world.

See [Github repo](https://github.com/blockchainbird/spending) for more info on what we are specifically doing for third party project involved.

#### Why we focus on *Digital Identity* to make a better world?
Because the internet is broken and the way we people accept being treated by governments and big corps is sick. It all starts with truly *self sovereign identity* and it'll be damn hard to achieve.

Why hard? Because it's not in the interest of those in power to give up power and opportunity, that'll end in a dystopia of totalitairianism and surveillance states. It might well take a few decades to sort this out.
